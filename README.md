## This is course project for the machine Leanring course.
## The goal of this project is to make a dog breed recongnition app using convolutionnal neural networks (CNN)

Our app is a desktop application coded in JAVA using JAVAFX to build the app.
For our CNN we did all the code in PYTHON3, using Tensorflow.

We could take an already trained CNN but that's not for us, we deceided to create our own CNN and train it by ourselves.
This project has two main features, the first one is to recognize the dog breed and the second one is to tell you which dog you look like.

## Files of this project
Notebook of data Vizualiation, one Notebook for the model, and one Notebook to test the model.
All the JAVA code.
You will also find the .exe in the project files.
You can download the dataset of dog Images, by breed at https://www.kaggle.com/miljan/stanford-dogs-dataset-traintest.

### Requirements
To run our project you will need a java IDE (espacially Intellij Idea from JETBRAINS) and Launch4J (to create a .exe from the .jar file)
You will also need python3 if you just want to look at the code of our notebook.


To generate your .exe from or code you can follow those link which explains how to do it (using Intellij and Launch4J)

## Application screenshots & functionnalities

### Menu : 

![MENU](https://github.com/LucLop/DoggoLookalike/blob/master/READMEPICTURES/DoggolookalikeMenu.png "Menu")


You can either choose the Dog button or the Human Button, if you click Dog, you will be in the dog breed recongnition functionality. If you click Human you will be in the functionality that tells you which dog you look like. To give an image to our model you need to drag and drop the image (that's easy to do on a computer).


### Here you are in the dog functionality :

### Once you've uploaded you image you got this :

### And you can press the validate button to start the prediction, and if everything goes right you'll have the prediction label:
