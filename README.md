## This is course project for the machine Leanring course.
## The goal of this project is to make a dog breed recongnition app using convolutionnal neural networks (CNN)

Our app is a desktop application coded in JAVA
For our CNN we did all the code in PYTHON

We could take an already trained CNN but that's not for us, we deceided to create our own CNN and train it by ourselves.
This project has two main features, the first one is to recognize the dog breed and the second one is to tell you which dog you look like.

## Files of this project
Notebook of data Vizualiation, one Notebook for the model, and one Notebook to test the model.
All the JAVA code.
You will also find the .exe in the project files.
Dataset of dog Images, by breed.

### Requirements
To run our project you will need a java IDE (espacially Intellij Idea from JETBRAINS) and Launch4J (to create a .exe from the .jar file)
You will also need python3 if you just want to look at the code of our notebook.


To generate your .exe from or code you can follow those link which explains how to do it (using Intellij and Launch4J)
